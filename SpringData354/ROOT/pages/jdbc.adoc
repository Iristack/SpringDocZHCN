The Spring Data JDBC module applies core Spring concepts to the development of solutions that use JDBC database drivers aligned with xref:jdbc/domain-driven-design.adoc[Domain-driven design principles].
We provide a "`template`" as a high-level abstraction for storing and querying aggregates.

This document is the reference guide for Spring Data JDBC support.
It explains the concepts and semantics and syntax.

This chapter points out the specialties for repository support for JDBC.
This builds on the core repository support explained in xref:repositories/introduction.adoc[Working with Spring Data Repositories].
You should have a sound understanding of the basic concepts explained there.
